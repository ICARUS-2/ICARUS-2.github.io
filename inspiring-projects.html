               <p>RTX is nVidia's latest addition to its long line of PC graphics cards.
                    Based on nVidia's own Turing architecture, the technology behind these cards allows for real-time ray tracing,
                    making images and reflections clearer and more detailed than ever. These cards
                    come in several models: The RTX 2060, 2060 Super, 2070, 2070 Super, 2080, 2080
                    Super, and finally the most powerful (and expensive) model: The 2080TI.

                <p> Released in 2016, Overwatch is Blizzard Entertainment's latest 
                    team-based first-person shooter. The game places two teams of 6 against
                    each other in a fight to capture objectives and move payloads. With a
                    diverse cast of 32 heroes with many abilities, there are endless possibilities
                    when it comes to strategizing to win the game.

                <p>Serato DJ Pro is a professional program used by DJs to do live mixing
                    and track blending. It can use up to four audio channels and is often
                    used with external hardware such as software controllers, turntables,
                    and CDJ players. The software is upgrade-ready with expansion packs that
                    allow users to connect digital vinyl systems (DVS) as well as video playback
                    devices to enhance performances

                <p>As PCs get more and more powerful, they tend to generate a lot more heat from
                    components such as the CPU and GPU, especially when overclocking. For PCs that
                    cannot be cooled properly using heatsinks and fans, watercooling is a viable 
                    solution. A watercooling system consists of a combination of pumps, tubing, and 
                    radiators in order to disperse heat more effeciently and quietly than standard air coolers.
