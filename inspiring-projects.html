                <p>RTX is nVidia's latest addition to its long line of PC graphics cards.
                    Based on nVidia's own Turing architecture, the technology behind these cards allows for real-time ray tracing,
                    meaning that it can simulate the way light behaves in the real world. These cards
                    come in several models: The RTX 2060, 2060 Super, 2070, 2070 Super, 2080, 2080
                    Super, and finally the most powerful (and expensive) model: The 2080TI.

                <p> Released in 2016, Overwatch is Blizzard Entertainment's latest 
                    team-based first-person shooter. Unlike most games that use a third-party 
                    engine like Frostbite or Unity, it runs on its own proprietary engine built specifically
                    for it. The game uses AI not only in the bots, but the matchmaking as well. The game learns
                    your skill level based on a number of factors in how you play, and uses that data to
                    match you with other players of similar skill.

                <p>Serato DJ Pro is a professional program used to do live mixing
                    and track blending. The software's technology is capable of emulating the behaviors of
                    physical media such as CDs and vinyl records right within its own application.
                    It is often used with external tactile interface devices such as software controllers,
                    CDJ players, and turntables in order to be able to manipulate the tracks playing through the computer.

                <p>As PCs get more and more powerful, they tend to generate a lot more heat from
                    components such as the CPU and GPU, especially today's age of overclocking. For PCs that
                    cannot be cooled properly using heatsinks and fans, watercooling is a viable 
                    solution. A watercooling system consists of a combination of pumps, tubing, and 
                    radiators in order to disperse heat more effeciently and quietly than standard air coolers.
